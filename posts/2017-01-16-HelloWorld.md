A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs or displays "Hello, World!" to the user. Being a very simple program in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language for a working program.[1] It is often the very first program people write when they are new to the language.

### Hello

```
#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
  printf("hello, world\n");
}
```
